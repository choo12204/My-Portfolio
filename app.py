I‚Äôm an aspiring **Robotics Engineer** currently pursuing a degree in **Robotics Engineering**, on track for a **2:1 or higher**. My passion lies in the intersection of **real-time embedded systems**, **mechanical design**, and **automotive innovation**.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve immersed myself in a variety of technical projects‚Äîranging from building **mechatronic puzzle** and **self-balancing line-following robot**, to designing **control systems** and working on **CAD-based mechanical assemblies**. I enjoy pushing the limits of what's possible, especially when combining hardware and software to solve real-world problems.

My academic and extracurricular involvement with teams like **Team Bath Roving** and **Team Bath Hydrobotics** has honed my skills in:
- **Mechatronic integration**
- **Team-based design and development**
- **Rapid prototyping using 3D printing and electronics**

Outside of engineering, I‚Äôm active in sports, event organising, and creative technical hobbies like building LEGO-based robots and designing **Minecraft data packs** to experiment with logic and automation.

My goal is to become a forward-thinking engineer who blends creativity with robust technical foundations‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs in **autonomous robotics**, **intelligent machines**, or **cutting-edge aerospace systems**.
