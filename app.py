        I'm a passionate and curious engineering student pursuing an MEng in Robotics Engineering at the University of Bath. My journey blends creativity with technical problem-solving, from building quadruped robots in my free time to designing high-performance PCBs and embedded systems for real-world applications.
        
        I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design, electronics, and software. Through hands-on projects in CAD, control systems, power electronics, and machine learning, I've developed a solid foundation in designing and simulating complex systems. I‚Äôve also contributed to open-source game development communities and led teams in both sports and engineering competitions.
        
        Whether it‚Äôs crafting a functional Arduino case, fine-tuning a buck converter in LTspice, or soldering components on a multilayer PCB, I take pride in learning by doing. I enjoy sharing what I learn, through code, collaboration, or community engagement.

        - Verified that impedance matching (R = 200Œ©) reduces reflections and maintains clean signal transitions across Vin(t), Vout(t), Vnear(t), and Vfar(t).
        - Demonstrated how increasing C‚ÇÄ from 0.25nF to 1nF intensifies crosstalk, shown by waveform distortions at Vnear and Vfar.
        - Compared 3.3V CMOS input levels with matched vs mismatched loads; higher voltage increased signal swing but preserved shape when properly matched.

        - Reinforced the importance of impedance matching and capacitive isolation to maintain signal integrity in PCB and communication line design.
